                <h2>What is CORONAVIRUS???</h2>
                <p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in humans. They get their name, “corona,” from the many crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are examples of coronaviruses that cause illness in humans.
                    The new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The virus has since spread to all continents (except Antarctica).</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>How Does it Spread???</h2>
                <p>When the virus travels in respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, sings or breathes near you (within six feet). This is thought to be the main way COVID-19 is spread.
                    When the virus travels in small respiratory droplets that linger in the air for minutes to hours from an infected person who is more than six feet away or has since left the space. This method of spread is more likely to occur in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.
                    From close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person.
                    By touching surfaces that the virus has landed on, then touching your eyes, mouth, or nose before washing your hands.
                    COVID-19 enters your body through your mouth, nose or eyes. The virus travels to the back of your nasal passages and mucous membrane in the back of your throat. It attaches to cells there, begins to multiply and moves into lung tissue. </p>

    <p class="tricon">Doctors form an essential part of an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. They have critical roles in diagnosis, containment and treatment, and their commitment to treat despite increased personal risks is essential for a successful public health response. Frontline workers have been experiencing high work volume, personal risk and societal pressure to meet extraordinary demands for healthcare. Despite this traditional public health ethics has paid little attention to the protection of the rights of doctors.</p><br>
    <p class="tricon1">Some objections are not strong enough moral justifications to pressure all doctors into working in circumstances beyond their expected role that they consider to be morally, psychologically or physically unacceptable. The moral, psychological and physical acceptability of frontline COVID-19 work is likely to be determined by a number of important factors, such as the level of personal risk of serious illness, personal circumstances, specialty, career stage and met/unmet reciprocal obligations</p>

            <h2>Special Circumstances</h3>
             <p>Emerging threats of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 demand much more than that doctors continue to work as normal. </p>
        <img src="Images/i1.jpg" alt="" class="homey">
        <p>What distinguishes normal duty from acting beyond the call of duty is not always clear-cut.However, experience so far suggests that in the current epidemic doctors are subject to risk of illness, risk of death, fatigue from extended hours, moral distress (when being party to difficult treatment decisions, such as prioritisation of patients for ventilators) and potential legal and professional risks when be asked to work at the limits of their competencies.</p>
        <p>Pandemics may necessitate longer hours (and corresponding increased exposure to the virus), potential quarantines and assignments outside one’s normal specialty.</p>    
        <p>Lastly, whereas much has been written on what makes a good doctor, less attention has been said about the good patient.Obligations towards the professional have been suggested to include informing the professional about any known risk of infection,truthfulness, compliance, tolerance and trust.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="col">
         <h2>Whom does it apply</h3>
          <p>While we have so far looked at the duty of care of doctors, this is not a homogenous group. All doctors have a duty (within limitations) to care for their patients, but an acutely unwell and infectious patient might not be within the normal range of practice of some specialties. </p>
     <img src="Images/i3.jpg" alt="" class="homey">
     <p>If we compare an infectious disease physician with an ophthalmic surgeon, two arguments could be made for the greater duty of the infectious disease physician: this could arise from both their greater skill in managing patients with COVID-19 and by their choice of specialty. It could be argued that by choosing to train in the management of infectious diseases they have implicitly agreed to accept a predetermined level of risk,and therefore, frontline pandemic work may fall within the scope of agreed duties.</p>
     <p>Licenced doctors may not be the only doctors asked to help care for patients during the pandemic. </p>    
  </div>
  <div class="col">
     <h2>Doctor's Lives!!!</h3>
 <img src="Images/i4.jpg" alt="" class="homey">  
 <p>From both an ethical and pragmatic perspective, doctors must be viewed in the context of rich lives with multiple competing demands. We should encourage doctors to meet the demand for medical aid in the pandemic, but those who make the sacrifices and increased efforts are owed reciprocal obligations in return. Further work is required to define these professional standards that should take into account the capacity for structural factors that may influence doctor’s agency and should aim to meet these reciprocal obligations. </p>    
<p>However, it seems clear that the duty to treat cannot be ‘absolute’—that doctors have a duty to work regardless of the circumstance. Doctors have rights to protection and to care during an infectious disease outbreak, as do other members of society.</p>
