                <h1 class="lh">Symptoms Of COVID19</h3>
                <p>People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:

                    Fever or chills,
                    Cough,
                    Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
                    Fatigue,
                    Muscle or body aches,
                    Headache,
                    New loss of taste or smell,
                    Sore throat,
                    Congestion or runny nose,
                    Nausea or vomiting,
                    Diarrhea </p>
            </div>
            <div class="lcol">
                <h1 class="lh">Emergency Medical Attention</h3>
                <p>Trouble breathing
                    Persistent pain or pressure in the chest,
                    New confusion,
                    Inability to wake or stay awake.
                    Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lcol">
                <h1 class="lh">When to QUARANTINE</h3>
                <p>Quarantine if you have been in close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) with someone who has COVID-19, unless you have been fully vaccinated. People who are fully vaccinated do NOT need to quarantine after contact with someone who had COVID-19 unless they have symptoms. However, fully vaccinated people should get tested 3-5 days after their exposure, even if they don’t have symptoms and wear a mask indoors in public for 14 days following exposure or until their test result is negative.</p>

                <h1 class="lh">When to ISOLATE</h3>
                <p>Isolation is used to separate people infected with COVID-19 from those who are not infected.
                    People who are in isolation should stay home until it’s safe for them to be around others. At home, anyone sick or infected should separate from others, stay in a specific “sick room” or area, and use a separate bathroom (if available)</p>

                <h1 class="lh">Importance of Masks</h3>
                <p>Masks are a simple barrier to help prevent your respiratory droplets from reaching others. Studies show that masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth.
                    You should wear a mask, even if you do not feel sick. This is because several studies have found that people with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are not yet showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can still spread the virus to other people. Wearing a mask helps protect those around you, in case you are infected but not showing symptoms.</p>

                <h1 class="lh">Vaccines</h3>
                <p>FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines protect against Delta and other known variants.
                    These vaccines are effective at keeping people from getting COVID-19, getting very sick, and dying.
                    We don’t know how effective the vaccines will be against new variants that may arise.</p>

            <div class="caption">
                <p>Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into developmentSafe and effective vaccines are a game-changing tool: but for the foreseeable future we must continue wearing masks, cleaning our hands, ensuring good ventilation indoors, physically distancing and avoiding crowds. </p>
