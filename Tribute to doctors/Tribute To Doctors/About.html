        <p class="ab">798 doctors died during second wave of Covid-19 across country</p>
        <p class="abo">Doctors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease.
            Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.
            Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. </p>

           <h1>Final Words</h1><br>
           <p>
            While the deadly virus has brought attention to the inadequacies in the health-care systems across the globe, doctors and health-care workers have been risking their lives to save all of us. They are also risking the lives of their family members, which indeed is a huge sacrifice. On top of that, the shortage of face masks, shields, and protective gear is not helping. And this makes the efforts of the medical workers even more extraordinary. On occasion of the Doctors' Day (March 30, 2020 USA and Australia), the stories of the medical heroes putting themselves on the forefront to fight the virus are inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time.

           <p>They deserve all the appreciation and support. The sacrifice of doctors and healthcare workers across the globe will not go to waste. Humanity will always be grateful to them for what they are doing during these unprecedented times. The respect for healthcare professionals has grown manifolds in the hearts of people. It is good to see that the Government of India along with the governments worldwide have decided to allocate more budget for healthcare in their respective countries. The world is taking the health, healthcare professionals and hospitals more seriously, as it appears. More work is expected to be done for hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure in India as well as in countries across the world.</p>
